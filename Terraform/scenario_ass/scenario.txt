Assessment Scenario
You are working as a junior cloud engineer at TechCorp, and your team needs to deploy a new web application infrastructure on AWS. The senior engineer has provided you with the requirements below. You need to create a complete Terraform configuration that provisions the required infrastructure.

Business Requirements:
TechCorp is launching a new web application that needs:

High availability across multiple availability zones
Secure network isolation with public and private subnets
Load balancing for web traffic
Bastion host for secure administrative access
Scalable architecture that can grow with the business
Technical Requirements
You must create Terraform configurations to provision the following AWS infrastructure:

1. Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
VPC with CIDR block 10.0.0.0/16
Name tag: techcorp-vpc
Enable DNS hostnames and DNS support
2. Subnets
Create the following subnets in two different availability zones:

Public Subnets:
techcorp-public-subnet-1 – CIDR: 10.0.1.0/24
techcorp-public-subnet-2 – CIDR: 10.0.2.0/24
Private Subnets:
techcorp-private-subnet-1 – CIDR: 10.0.3.0/24
techcorp-private-subnet-2 – CIDR: 10.0.4.0/24

3. Internet Gateway & NAT Gateways
Internet Gateway attached to the VPC
NAT Gateway in each public subnet for private subnet internet access
Appropriate route tables and associations

4. Security Groups
Web Security Group: Allow HTTP (80), HTTPS (443) from anywhere, SSH (22) from Bastion Security Group.
Database Security Group: Allow MySQL (3306) only from web security group Allow SSH(22) from Bastion Security Group.
Bastion Security Group: Allow SSH (22) from your current IP address only

5. EC2 Instances
Bastion Host:
t3.micro instance in public subnet
Use Amazon Linux 2 AMI
Associate Elastic(Public) IP

Web Servers:
2x t3.micro instances (one in each private subnet)
Use Amazon Linux 2 AMI
Install Apache web server (user data script)

Database Server:
1x t3.small instance in private subnet
Use Amazon Linux 2 AMI
Install PostgresDB using (user data script)
NOTE: Setup Access from Bastion to Web and Dev servers using username and password. Usage of ssh keys is an optional alternative.

6. Application Load Balancer
Application Load Balancer in public subnets
Target group pointing to web servers
Health check configuration
7. Variables and Outputs
Use variables for: region, instance types, key pair name, your IP address
Output: VPC ID, Load Balancer DNS name, Bastion public IP

Space Mission Log Analysis Challenge
Background
You are a data analyst at the Interplanetary Space Agency. Your task is to analyze a complex log file containing data about thousands of space missions conducted between 2030 and 2070. We want to find the security code of the longest successful Mars mission in the database.

Instructions
You are provided with a file called space_missions.log
The file contains information about space missions with fields separated by '|' characters
Fields: Date | Mission ID | Destination | Status | Crew Size | Duration (days) | Success Rate | Security Code
Use awk to analyze this file and find the mission that meets the criteria
Submit the security code as your answer (format: ABC-123-XYZ)
Tips
The file contains commented lines (starting with #) and other irrelevant data
Field separators may have inconsistent spacing
Only consider missions with "Completed" status
"Duration" is measured in days
Example Line
2045-07-12 | KLM-1234 | Mars | Completed | 5 | 387 | 98.7 | TRX-842-YHG
Good luck, analyst!


awk -F'|' '/^#|^SYSTEM:|^CONFIG:|^CHECKSUM:|^CHECKPOINT:/{next} {for(i=1;i<=NF;i++)gsub(/^[ \t]+|[ \t]+$/,"",$i); if($3=="Mars"&&$4=="Completed"){d=$6+0; if(d>max){max=d;code=$8}}} END{print code}' space_missions.log
